<h1>Information</h1>
<p>Hurricane Maria is the worst hurricane to make landfall in the United States in nearly 100 years. A category 4 storm, with winds up to 155 miles per hour, it hit Puerto Rico and the island of Dominica directly and wreaked havoc. 15 people have been reported dead on Dominica, Puerto Rico has been completely cut off from electricity and will not be able to regain power for months, and whole towns will need to be rebuilt. Governor Ricardo Rossello has claimed that the storm has 'destroyed us'. Floods, storm surges, and lingering rainfall are causing increasing problems. Puerto Rico had recently declared bankrupcy and were already in a state of economic turmoil. This storm has gravely exacerbated their situation, destroying the little financial assets they did have. Puerto Rico is in a grave state and desperately need our help.</p>
